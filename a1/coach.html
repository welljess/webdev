                  <h6>Meet our Coaches</h6>

                    <blockquote>"I have been given great feedback and encouragement by the TSS coaches. This last winter I took part in the Winter Cycling class and it made a huge difference to my spring rides. The coaches are caring professionals and they know their business."</blockquote>
                    <p>Our mission at TSS is to help you reach your athletic goals through motivation, support, and education. We have years of experience with athletes of all ages and abilities and we're happy to assist any athlete committed to pursuing his or her dreams.</p>
                    <p>We offer one-on-one coaching, evaluation, and instruction; but we also offer small group practices. Our classes are never large in number. We believe that a low coach-to-athlete ratio provides the best results in the shortest time.</p>
                    <p>Come in and introduce yourself to our team of coaches and educators.</p>

                        <img src="images/coach2.png">

                        <p>Kevin is a student of body mechanics. In addition to a Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology, Kevin brings certification in Swim Instruction and coaching. He has coached numerous recreational and elite athletes, including Sprint and Ironman triathletes.</p>

                        <p>In addition to coaching individual athletes, Kevin has coached a variety of teams and groups. Kevin coached Swimming and Cross Country at Austin High School and Palmer Country Day School. As Head Coach, his swim teams set school records in 9 out of 11 events, won the Mid-Texas Conference Championship, and consistently finished in the top 3 at the Small School State meet.

                        <p>Since being talked into his first triathlon at 16, Kevin has always enjoyed the challenge the sport provides. His motivation comes from the desire to improve himself, not the desire to beat others. Starting as a middle of the pack athlete, his initial goal was to work his way through the distances which culminated with an Ironman finish in 2010. Bill remains a student of the sport while helping others achieve their fitness and racing goals.</p>

                        <p>After completing her USAT certification training, Tammy designed the course of workouts we use with our runners and cyclists. Tammy is also our nutritionist; she believes that reaching one's fitness goals requires a holistic approach in which what goes into the body is as important as what comes out.</p>

                        <p>Coming from an engineering background, Tammy looks at things from an analytical point of view. Recently Tammy completed two seminars on cycling with power meters.
