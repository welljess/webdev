                    <h3>Nanotechnology</h3>
  
                      <p>Defining nanotechnology can be difficult as its meaning is different depending upon the industry. The dictionary definition is the manipulation of particles at the molecular level.</p>
                      <p>Nantechnology has many applications. In the medical field, it is studied to improve the quality of healthcare and prescription drugs. In the electonic field, it involves improving machines to make them last longer. Nanotechnology is also applied towards improving air quality and water quality.</p>
