                    <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>

                    <p>The official definition of artificial intelligence(AI) is the theory and development of computer
                        systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Today, there are many
                        intelligent machines that work and act like humans.</p>
                    <p>If you use voice assistance, such as Siri or Alexa, you are using one form of AI. Self-driving
                        cars are another example of AI.
                        AI is based on algorithms that have programmed responses based on user interaction. Some forms
                        of AI allow it to improve its algorithms, and, in essence, get smarter.</p>

                            <p></p><img src="images/machine-learning.png" alt="machine learning"></p>

                            <p> According to an article in Smithsonian.com, AI is not one but hundreds of specialized
                                tasks.
                                AI algorithms are used within the stock market. Its algorithms make new algorithms that
                                have surprised researchers.
                                <br>
                                <br> According to the article, AI is really taking off and is expected to replace
                                millions of jobs, from insurance to transportation, and the medical field.
                                Robots are expected to help care for the elderly.

                                <br>
                                <br>Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Stephen Hawking have all warned about the continued
                                development of AI.
                                Collectively, they felt that continued AI development, done improperly, could spell
                                disaster for the human race.
